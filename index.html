				<h2>September 16th, 2024</h2>
				<h3>Rebuilding My Website</h3>
				<p>Dear Reader,</p>
				<p>Today was an exciting day—I finally took the time to recode my website from scratch! Instead of
					relying on pre-built templates or frameworks, I challenged myself by using my own custom HTML, CSS,
					and JavaScript. It was a rewarding experience, allowing me to have complete control over the design
					and functionality. I'm using Formspree's API for my contact form, which makes managing messages and
					inquiries much easier without needing to set up a backend server. The website is hosted on GitHub,
					which keeps it accessible, reliable, and version-controlled. It's always satisfying to see a project
					come together smoothly, and this time was no exception.</p>
				<p>Now that the site is live and running, I’m planning to expand my skills by diving deeper into
					frameworks like React. I've been curious about how frameworks can speed up development and enhance
					the user experience, so this feels like the perfect next step. Along with React, I’m exploring other
					modern tools and libraries that could take my coding abilities to the next level.</p>
				<p>On a different note, I’m excited for the upcoming fall season. As the weather starts to cool down,
					I'm getting ready for one of my favorite activities—snowboarding! I can't wait to hit the slopes
					again. It's always a refreshing way to unwind and reset during the colder months.

					This fall, I’m balancing my passion for learning new tech with my love for the outdoors, and I
					couldn’t be more excited for what’s ahead. Stay tuned for updates on my journey with React and my
					winter adventures on the mountain!</p>
