Dear Reader,

Today marks the first day of my adventure in the LA area. Thureau once wrote, â€œI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately". Well... I've decided to take this weekend to live more deliberately. While my career and education are extremely important to me, sometimes I need to be a little spontaneous to truly feel <strong>alive</strong>. I plan on exploring various cafes in the area and just walking around. The people here are very diverse and I am sure they have many stories to tell.

Dear Reader,

    This will be my second blog post. Today is the first day of the grad strike at UC Santa Cruz. Unfortunately, I still have to come to campus for work because otherwise I will not be paid. Since two out of my four classes have already moved to zoom and my discussion sections have been cancelled for the remainder of the quarter, I am hoping that I will have more time to work on law school applications and learn more about web development. 

    Today, I will upload my blog posts. I messed around with the borders on my posts so that they'll now be more aethetically pleasing. In the future, I am hoping to make it so that they'll be sorted somehow instead of just flowing down the page. I am also considering looking into password protecting websites so that I can experiment with creating private blog webpages. Please let me know if you have any suggestions with what I should work on implementing next.
	
Until next time,
Pablo Theo

Dear Reader,

    Welcome to my first blog post. Today is November 12th, 2022. I am writing this post on a flight from Denver, CO to San Jose, CA. I've just come back from visiting some old friends and taking my LSAT in a library in Fort Collins. This weekend offered me some valuable perspective on how I want to live my life.
			
    I enjoy traveling and being able to see how different people live. Taking the LSAT was a struggle, but being able to take it only furthered my resolve to make it to law school. I thought a lot about my future with web development, and I want to push myself to become a better web developer as well. I have been slacking, but web development is a skill that I would like to continue growing throughout my life. My plan for this week is to take a few hours out of my day to focus on learning more javascript.

Best regards,
Pablo Theo
